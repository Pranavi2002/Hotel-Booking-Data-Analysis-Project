## üè® Hotel Booking Data Analysis ‚Äî Final Summary

### üîç **Objective**

The project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a hotel booking dataset from Kaggle, with the aim of understanding:

* Guest behavior
* Booking and cancellation trends
* Pricing and revenue patterns
* Geographic distribution of customers
* Stay durations and market segments

The findings are useful for **hotel management, marketing, and revenue optimization**.

---

## üìÇ **Data Overview**

* The dataset consists of **city** and **resort** hotel bookings.
* Key columns include: `hotel`, `is_canceled`, `lead_time`, `arrival_date`, `country`, `adr` (average daily rate), `stays`, `guests`, and more.
* It includes **missing values**, **outliers**, and **imbalanced classes**, which were cleaned and handled before analysis.

---

## üßπ **Data Preparation**

* Rows with inappropriate values (e.g., zero guests) were removed.
* Missing values were handled.
* Columns were combined to derive useful features like **total\_nights** and **total\_guests**.
* Dataset was split into **clean subsets** for more accurate visualizations.

## üìä **Key Visualizations & Findings**

### 1. **Booking Trends**

* **City hotels** receive more bookings than **resort hotels**.
* Booking volumes differ significantly by **hotel type**, **month**, and **market segment**.

### 2. **Top Guest Countries**

* Guests are mainly from **Portugal, Great Britain, and France**, accounting for **\~50%** of bookings.
* A **choropleth map** and **bar chart** visualized the geographical spread of guests.

### 3. **Guest Stay Duration**

* Majority of bookings are for **1‚Äì4 nights**.
* Resort hotel guests tend to stay longer than city hotel guests.

### 4. **Room Pricing Patterns**

* The **average daily rate (ADR)** varies across the year, with **higher prices in summer months**.
* City hotels show more pronounced seasonal price changes than resort hotels.

### 5. **Booking Cancellations**

* A significant percentage of bookings are **canceled**, especially for city hotels.
* **Highest cancellations** occur in the **summer months** (June‚ÄìAugust).
* Booking cancellation is also tied to **lead time** (i.e., longer lead times often result in more cancellations).

### 6. **Market Segment Analysis**

* The **online travel agent (OTA)** segment dominates the bookings.
* Cancellations are more frequent in OTA bookings compared to other channels.

## üìà **Visual Tools Used**

* **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for static plots (bar charts, count plots, distribution plots)
* **Plotly** for interactive plots (bar charts and choropleth maps)

Total Plots: **22**, including:

* Booking counts
* Cancellations by hotel type/month
* Guest distribution maps
* Room price variation trends
* Stay duration charts

## üí° **Key Insights**

* City hotels are more popular but also face higher cancellation rates.
* ADR (price per night) peaks in summer, aligning with high demand.
* Guests from Europe dominate, especially from Portugal, UK, and France.
* Marketing efforts can be optimized by targeting high-booking countries and managing cancellation risks based on lead time.

## ‚úÖ **Conclusion**

This EDA uncovered patterns in bookings, cancellations, pricing, and guest behavior. The insights can support:

* **Dynamic pricing models**
* **Targeted marketing campaigns**
* **Inventory and staff planning**
